# Application Firewall Project
<<<<<<< HEAD

This project involves developing an application firewall for endpoints that can identify and restrict access to external networks/hosts.
The firewall provides granular control, allowing restrictions based on domains, IP addresses, and protocols for each application.
A centralized web console manages policies, and agents monitor network usage and detect anomalies using AI/ML.

## Components
- Firewall agents (Windows/Linux)
- Central Web Console (Streamlit and Flask)
- AI/ML Models for anomaly detection
- Appwrite for database management
- Real-time network monitoring

## Setup
Run `setup.ps1` to create the project structure and initialize the environment.

## Docker
Use Docker to manage your environment and containers.
